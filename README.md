# PDP React

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits on App.js.

There is one branch created with the steps committed in it, creating multiple branches resulted in some deployment error due to which I created another repository with 1 branch and specific commits.

## Development & Challenges

The assessment overall was very challenging because I have not attempted or worked with React.js before this. The assessment is developed with the very basic ```create-react-app``` approach since I found that a little easy to pick in a short span of time.

Despite of the challenges on the technology, I have tried my best to submit a working assessment. The UI of the app is as asked in the task with following functionalities:

- The colors of the products can be selected and are reflected
- The description and price of the product changes depending on the selection
- More products can also be selected and viewed

The specific challenges whilst developing were as follows:

- Connecting to an API (JSON file) gave me multiple errors and did not present the result as I wanted hence I have created the product details fetching section within the main App.js file itself.
- The other challenging part was testing each component separately.

## Deployment

The app is deployed on Heroku by connecting it to the GitHub repository.\
